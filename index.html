	<p>Welcome to my website on the Anime/Manga series One Punch Man! One Punch Man was created by an author using the pseudonym One. I first discovered One Punch Man in 2015 when my friend told me to check it out. Soon I was hooked and binged watched the entire first season. One Punch Man is a simple, humble man with an incredibly devastating finishing move, he can defeat any opponent using only one punch. On this site we will learn more about the character of One Punch Man who is named Saitama. We have also included an application for you to be One Punch Man's next apprentice.
